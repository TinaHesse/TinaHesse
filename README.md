Hello I’m @TinaHesse

This is a collaboration page for reseserch: Operation Legacy is an ongoing investigation into the financial networks that helped fuel Nazi war efforts, particularly those that found refuge in Switzerland’s banking system. Through uncovering the intertwining of wealth, power, and influence from WWII to present-day, this project aims to expose how these historical systems are connected to current financial dynasties.

This repository contains extensive research data, documents, and analysis on the subject, providing an in-depth look at how WWII finance networks impacted the modern financial elite.

Key Objectives:

Uncover WWII financial networks: Documenting how money was moved and hidden during and after the war, especially in neutral territories like Switzerland.
Identify modern financial dynasties: Exposing how historical wealth continues to shape modern financial institutions and influential families.
Expose Swiss banking ties: Investigating the role of Swiss banks in laundering and protecting Nazi-era assets, and their ongoing ties to elite families today.
Catalog secretive transactions: Creating a comprehensive database of historical financial documents and contemporary connections to help researchers and historians.
